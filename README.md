# YelpDataScienceProject
Completed in November 2015, I created this project for the Capstone Projects for Johns Hopkins Data Science certification program on Coursera.com.

Yelp data is the property of Yelp, and is not duplicated here in any form.
At the time of publication, the data for this study could be found at: http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset.

Since the inception of the Yelp Elite Squad program in 2005, fewer than 1% of Yelp users have ever achieved elite status, and according to the Yelp blog,  “… there is no set check list …” for attaining elite status.  The goal of the project was to determine, from text mining and analysis of the Yelp data, a checklist for elite user status.

Files contained in this repo:
- ingestJSON.R:  Functions used to ingest, modify and flatten the Yelp Academic data set
- analyzeYelp.R: Fuctions used to analyze the modified Yelp data.
- EliteYelpUsers.Rmd: The Rmarkdown file used to create the PDF paper for submssion for the Capstone project.
- YelpEliteUsers.Rpres: The Rpresentation file used to create the HTML slide deck for submission for the Capstone project.
- img/*: Image files used in the PDF and Presentation files.
